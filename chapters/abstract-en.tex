With the development of information, there has been an increasing number of unstructured information. And it plays an important role in decision of government and enterprise, etc. How to manage the unstructured information efficiently, mine the data and knowledge, extract the implicit information, provide a visual image analysis, and then support the government and enterprise's decision have become the main issues to be settled urgently. 	

In this question for discussion, we mainly have a research in indicator of enterprise documents from the Beijing Science and Technology Commission and try to obtain the indicators of the unstructured information, and then provide a visual image analysis. It includes three aspects: First, to design a set of practical information extraction algorithm; second, through the use of the Dundas Chart toolbox, providing visual analysis; third, completed Enterprise Information Management System which meet customers requirement.

The beginning of the dissertation introduced the background of the project, introduced the background of the system and research value. Second, detailing information extraction algorithms and principles of Information Visualization. Third, the dissertation elaborated the system's requirement, specifically introduced the system design and implementation. Finally, some possible improvements and future works were presented.
